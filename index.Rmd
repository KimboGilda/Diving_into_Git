There are cases where you have to deal with two different `SSH keys` on your accounts. In most cases you have to deal with a personal account as well as an organisational account. In these cases we have to deal with adding the one of the two keys into the active `SSH agent`.


## Adding SSH key

First of all we have to ensure that the **ssh-agent** is running. To do so, we do the following:

````{bash, eval = FALSE}
eval $(ssh-agent  -s)

# add your private key to the ssh-agent
# as an example we assume that our key is called "mykey"

ssh-add ~/.ssh/mykey
```


## Pull before Push

One quite common problem that arises in our first encounters with the beautiful world of `git` is when our commits are rejected _because the remote contains work that we do not have locally_. In this case, the first thing every user does, is to try to pull the data from the remote repository.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%', paged.print=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/pullBpush.jpg')
```

Then the problem of potential conflicts arises. This can be resolved doing the following:

- Write `i` (for insert) and press ENTER
- Write your message
- Click ESC
- Write `:wq` and press ENTER


## Commit history via command line

To hard reset files to HEAD on Git, we can use the `git reset` command with the `-hard` option and then specify the `HEAD`.  
Assuming that OUR branch is called **master** both locally and remotely and that your remote is called **origin** we could do the following:


````{bash, eval = FALSE}

git reset --hard HEAD # going back to HEAD

git reset --hard HEAD^ # going back to the commit before HEAD

git reset --hard HEAD~2 # going back two commits before HEAD
```
